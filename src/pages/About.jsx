        I built this to help me keep track of my off hand coding activities and
        give me something to look back on. Somewhat of a journal entry for me to

        I plan on building this React app using things that I am most
        comfortable with. I then plan on refactoring and using new pieces of
        React Router V6 and different bits of technology.
